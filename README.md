## Project 1 - Regression analysis and resampling methods
Project 1 description:
> The main aim of this project is to study in more detail various regression methods, including the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, RIDGE method and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We will first study how to fit polynomials to a specific two-dimensional function called Frankeâ€™s function. This is a function which has been widely used when testing various interpolation and fitting algorithms. Furthermore, after having established the model and the method, we will employ resamling techniques such as cross-validation and  bootstrap in order to perform a proper assessment of our models. We will also study in detail the so-called Bias-Variance trade off. 
Finally we are going to use (real) digital terrain data and try to reproduce these data using the same methods. We will then explore which polynomial degree fits the data best.
